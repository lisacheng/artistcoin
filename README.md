Introduction

Tatiana Coin is the first user-created token that will crowdsource support from fans and the community for Tatiana Moroz to record her next album, the follow up to her single ‘The Bitcoin Song.’
As one of the early adopters of Bitcoin in the music community, Tatiana Moroz is collaborating with Adam Levine from Let’s Talk Bitcoin, Amos Ameiri from Colored Coins, Ryan Keenan from Distributed.Buzz, and Lisa Cheng from the Mastercoin Foundation to launch the first token created on the Bitcoin blockchain, specifically for the purpose of supporting arts and culture.

Project Proposition

The Crowdsale is an event where Tatiana Coin will be released to the public for sale on a limited time of 30 days. Each day participants can bid on their Tatiana Coins while she performs on her current summer tour, promoting and representing Tatiana Coin. 

Crowd Sale 

For a period of 30 days, 100,000 coins will be awarded to participants and the number of Tatiana coins awarded will vary by day as it will be based on their size of the total daily bids.
This method of distribution is meant to encourage participation and longevity of the crowdsale event, where participants can continue bidding on Tatiana Coins up until the end of the actual deadline. 
If Person A bids on Tatiana Coins in Week 1, his bid may be too low and will receive less than 30% of the Tatiana Coins for that day. Person A has the option to participate again in Week 4 whereby increasing his bid and likelihood that he will be awarded a greater share of the Tatiana Coins.


Participants

Tatiana Coin is a particpant-focused crowdsale, where users can be rewarded long after the  event has ended. This is intended to reward early and late adopters with the actual product they helped to create. 
These rewards are described in the Appendix further and can come in the form of a special music download, recording session, and private event invitation.

Conclusion

This approach of crowdsourcing resources is a new method of transparently raising support for artists and musicians in what was previously a competitive and difficult atmosphere. 
By giving the artists the ability to communicate directly with fans and supporters, where they can in turn contribute financially in any amount large or small is a great incentive for artists and fans alike to participate.
